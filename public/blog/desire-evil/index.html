Desire. It really is one of the greatest walls standing between a man and his own peace. Not all desires are evil, but the moment they become the master, the soul begins to rot. I have come to see more recently, there is something deceptive about it, the way it starts as a whisper—gentle, almost harmless. A itching for ease, for pleasure, for something just out of reach. It does not force itself upon you; it only asks. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be easier? Wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice? What harm is there in just this once? Or What if I just&mldr;</p><p>And so, the first battle is lost before you even know a war has begun.</p><div style="text-align:center;font-style:italic;margin:30px 0">"Have you seen the one who takes his own desire as his god?" (Qur'an 45:23)</div><p>If a man is ruled by his every longing, then what is he? Surely not free that is for sure. The one who follows every impulse is no different from a leaf in the wind, moving not by will but by force, never still, never rooted, always chasing, never finding. I have felt this feeling well; the restlessness of it, the hunger that only grows the more it is fed.What a strange thing desire is—it does not shout, nor does it demand. It simply lingers, persuading in the softest of tones, making promises it never intends to keep. It tells you that fulfillment is just within reach, that the next indulgence will be the one to finally satisfy. Yet, the moment it is grasped, it slips away, leaving only the same hunger, the same restlessness, urging you to chase again.</p><p>It really is just a illusion, a temporary want more than anything. The good thing is I have really improved on this aspect of life (<i> controlling you&rsquo;re own desires <i>).</p><br><div class=blog-tags>Tags:
