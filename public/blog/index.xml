      <title>2024 Reflection</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;2024 . What a year it was. The start of the year was epic, I had so much motivation to go do it all but as the year went by that motivation went away slowly. Which is why the quote&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Thinking is easy, acting is difficult, and to put one’s thoughts into action is the most difficult thing in the world.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; Johann Wolfgang von Goethe&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Really hits the head now, looking back throughout the year. I found myself casually flying through specific months, and that specific motivation I once had in January seemed more of a ghost of my thoughts. It really is easy to THINK, but to DO—this is truly what isn’t easy. But I must give myself credit; this year, I have taken lessons and wrote them down in my core memory. Also what is a year without lesson ay?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Random Thought On The Brothers Karamazov</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I first read Dostoevsky’s The Brothers Karamazov, it felt less like reading a novel and more like staring into a mirror that reflected humanity at its rawest. This book isn’t just about a dysfunctional family in 19th-century Russia—it’s about everything that makes us human: faith, doubt, love, betrayal, morality, and the struggle to make sense of it all.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The story starts with a messy family drama—a terrible father and his three very different sons. Right away, I could feel the tension in the air, and it hooked me. Each character brought their own perspective to the table: Alyosha with his quiet faith, Ivan with his cold rationalism, and Dmitri with his impulsive passion. It’s like Dostoevsky poured every possible way of thinking and feeling into these characters and then let them collide. Watching their relationships unravel felt so real, like I was sitting in the room with them, caught in the crossfire of their arguments and confessions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
