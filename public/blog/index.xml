"The soul in its early stages is like a rebellious horse. If not trained, it will never obey you."&lt;br>
— Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>I think the more I reflect on this series, the more I realize how little I actually knew about desire when I first started writing it all. It seemed like something simple at the start. A feeling really only. Something that could either be ignored or acted on. But now, after sitting with it, questioning , &lt;i>if i really wanted this&lt;/i>, falling to it sometimes and trying to rise again. The act of wanting, and that of wanting new things, which I mentioned in the last part, is what desire is—if not controlled with discipline, NOT pure motivation.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Desire and Its Nature – Pt. 2</title><link>https://www.abdisalam.blog/blog/desire-nature-pt2/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Apr 2025 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.abdisalam.blog/blog/desire-nature-pt2/</guid><description>&lt;div style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; margin: 30px 0;">
"Man is broad, too broad. I'd have him narrower."&lt;br>
— Fyodor Dostoevsky
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>This is a continuation of my earlier thoughts on desire. I still don’t have clear answers, but I am starting to see the layers more clearly. The surface is really obvious. Beneath it, things get harder and harder to define.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What I’ve been noticing lately is how quickly desire changes. The moment one goes out, another takes its place. It is not about what is wanted, but about the state of wanting itself (&lt;i> which I think is insane to think of&lt;/i> ). That condition seems to persist, regardless of whether anything is actually missing at all.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Desire and it's Nature</title><link>https://www.abdisalam.blog/blog/desire-evil/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Mar 2025 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.abdisalam.blog/blog/desire-evil/</guid><description>&lt;div style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; margin: 30px 0;">
"The chains of habit are too weak to be felt until they are too strong to be broken."&lt;br>
— Samuel Johnson
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Recently, I have been thinking if my desires-good or bad-control me? Desire. It really is one of the greatest walls standing between a man and his own peace. Not all desires are evil, but the moment they become the master, the soul begins to rot. I have come to see more recently, there is something deceptive about it, the way it starts as a whisper—gentle, almost harmless. A itching for ease, for pleasure, for something just out of reach. It does not force itself upon you; it only asks. Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be easier? Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be nice? What harm is there in just this once? Or What if I just&amp;hellip;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My 2025 Checklist</title><link>https://www.abdisalam.blog/blog/2025-checklist/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Dec 2024 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.abdisalam.blog/blog/2025-checklist/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is the list I have laid out for myself, though I expect new ideas will arise as January unfolds.

&lt;p>I’m currently reading the book, and I must say, it begins at a rather slow pace—though this is, of course, typical of Fyodor’s style. Books One was excellent, revealing a deeply dysfunctional family, which I believe is entirely the result of Fyodor Pavlovich’s character.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>2024 Reflection</title><link>https://www.abdisalam.blog/blog/reflection/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Dec 2024 11:43:53 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://www.abdisalam.blog/blog/reflection/</guid><description>&lt;p>2024 . What a year it was. The start of the year was epic, I had so much motivation to go do it all but as the year went by that motivation went away slowly. Which is why the quote&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Thinking is easy, acting is difficult, and to put one’s thoughts into action is the most difficult thing in the world.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; Johann Wolfgang von Goethe&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Really hits the head now, looking back throughout the year. I found myself casually flying through specific months, and that specific motivation I once had in January seemed more of a ghost of my thoughts. It really is easy to THINK, but to DO—this is truly what isn’t easy. But I must give myself credit; this year, I have taken lessons and wrote them down in my core memory. Also what is a year without lesson ay?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://www.abdisalam.blog/blog/firstblog-post/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.abdisalam.blog/blog/firstblog-post/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
