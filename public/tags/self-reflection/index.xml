      <description>&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center; font-style: italic; margin: 30px 0;&#34;&gt;&#xA;&#34;Man is broad, too broad. I&#39;d have him narrower.&#34;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;— Fyodor Dostoevsky&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a continuation of my earlier thoughts on desire. I still don’t have clear answers, but I am starting to see the layers more clearly. The surface is really obvious. Beneath it, things get harder and harder to define.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What I’ve been noticing lately is how quickly desire changes. The moment one goes out, another takes its place. It is not about what is wanted, but about the state of wanting itself (&lt;i&gt; which I think is insane to think of&lt;/i&gt; ). That condition seems to persist, regardless of whether anything is actually missing at all.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
