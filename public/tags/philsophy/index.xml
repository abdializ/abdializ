      <description>&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center; font-style: italic; margin: 30px 0;&#34;&gt;&#xA;&#34;The soul in its early stages is like a rebellious horse. If not trained, it will never obey you.&#34;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;— Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think the more I reflect on this series, the more I realize how little I actually knew about desire when I first started writing it all. It seemed like something simple at the start. A feeling really only. Something that could either be ignored or acted on. But now, after sitting with it, questioning , &lt;i&gt;if i really wanted this&lt;/i&gt;, falling to it sometimes and trying to rise again. The act of wanting, and that of wanting new things, which I mentioned in the last part, is what desire is—if not controlled with discipline, NOT pure motivation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
