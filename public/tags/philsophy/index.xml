"The soul in its early stages is like a rebellious horse. If not trained, it will never obey you."&lt;br>
— Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya

&lt;p>I think the more I reflect on this series, the more I realize how little I actually knew about desire when I first started writing it all. It seemed like something simple at the start. A feeling really only. Something that could either be ignored or acted on. But now, after sitting with it, questioning , &lt;i>if i really wanted this&lt;/i>, falling to it sometimes and trying to rise again. The act of wanting, and that of wanting new things, which I mentioned in the last part, is what desire is—if not controlled with discipline, NOT pure motivation.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
