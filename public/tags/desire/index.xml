      <description>&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center; font-style: italic; margin: 30px 0;&#34;&gt;&#xA;&#34;Man is broad, too broad. I&#39;d have him narrower.&#34;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;— Fyodor Dostoevsky&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a continuation of my earlier thoughts on desire. I still don’t have clear answers, but I am starting to see the layers more clearly. The surface is really obvious. Beneath it, things get harder and harder to define.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What I’ve been noticing lately is how quickly desire changes. The moment one goes out, another takes its place. It is not about what is wanted, but about the state of wanting itself (&lt;i&gt; which I think is insane to think of&lt;/i&gt; ). That condition seems to persist, regardless of whether anything is actually missing at all.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Desire. It really is one of the greatest walls standing between a man and his own peace. Not all desires are evil, but the moment they become the master, the soul begins to rot. I have come to see more recently, there is something deceptive about it, the way it starts as a whisper—gentle, almost harmless. A itching for ease, for pleasure, for something just out of reach. It does not force itself upon you; it only asks. Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be easier? Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be nice? What harm is there in just this once? Or What if I just&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
