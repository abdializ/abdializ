2024 . What a year it was. The start of the year was epic, I had so much motivation to go do it all but as the year went by that motivation went away slowly. Which is why the quote 

> "Thinking is easy, acting is difficult, and to put one’s thoughts into action is the most difficult thing in the world." -- Johann Wolfgang von Goethe

Really hits the head now, looking back throughout the year. I found myself casually flying through specific months, and that specific motivation I once had in January seemed more of a ghost of my thoughts. It really is easy to THINK, but to DO—this is truly what isn’t easy. But I must give myself credit; this year, I have taken lessons and wrote them down in my core memory. Also what is a year without lesson ay? 

I can also give myself credit professional wise, I have learned more skills and on the path to soon mastering additional skills not only in tech, but also in management, and writing. Speaking of writing, I discovered witin the latter days of the year that it's really relaxing to the soul and mind to just go write <i>(doesn't matter if its for research or self-entertainment)</i>.

Ever since 2020, reading has been an important activity for me, and this time last year, I declared I would:

{{% unchecked %}} Read 100 books this year {{% /unchecked %}}

Alas, this did not come to pass. The first thing that comes to mind is the array of excuses as to why, but such reasoning is, once again, the mark of <i>bad habits from one’s former self</i>—a resort to the comfort of justification. I did not read 100 books this year but rather 45, which is far below the goal I had set for myself.

This website has been on my calendar since March 2024, yet I only just completed it. Why is that? Why did it take so long? I can only say, <i>“It wasn’t my first choice.”</i> Though that is a decent answer, it does not excuse my complete disregard for something I had placed so high in my plans for the year. It was not right of me to neglect it so entirely, and I do plan to improve upon this in the coming year.

When it comes to people this year, I find it difficult to describe. It was my first year of college, and I discovered that isolation can be quite comforting. I wouldn’t call it loneliness, as I certainly don’t feel that way. Rather, I’ve come to recognize within myself a characteristic—an understanding that I ought not always to desire the company of others or strive to please them. Isolation does not equate to loneliness, and, honestly, that realization stands among my favorite lessons of this year.

Spiritually, this year has had its ups and downs—it is a journey, after all, and effort is required. Reflecting now, I can say that I have definitely improved from the previous year, though I am still far from where I wish to be. Perhaps it will be a lifelong journey to reach the place I aspire to, but if I continue on this path of steady improvement from year to year, that is what will bring me happiness and contentment.

Alas, this year was great. I improved, I showed old habits and reconginzed them, and discovered new weakness which one needs to do. All I gotta say now at the end of my reflection is
