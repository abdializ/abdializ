Trust is not the absence of fear, but the decision to move with faith despite it. To trust the will of God is to accept that clarity often comes after commitment — that we walk first, and the path reveals itself while walking.

## Surrender vs. Control
We try to control outcomes because uncertainty makes us anxious. But control is often an illusion. Surrender is not passivity — it is disciplined reliance. It is the quiet act of saying: I will do my part with excellence and leave the rest to the One who governs all outcomes.

## Trust in Uncertainty
Trust grows in the unknown. When we cannot predict or guarantee, we learn reliance, prayer, and patience. Delay is not denial; sometimes it is training. Sometimes protection. Sometimes a redirection toward something better than what we asked for.

## On Waiting and Comparison
I’ve lately felt like the things I want in life aren’t coming. Others have them, but I don’t—and I beat myself up for it. Why? If I say I trust the will of God, then my heart has to learn to wait without turning bitter, to try without measuring my worth by timelines and comparisons.
