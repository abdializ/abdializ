## Abdisalam Sharif Ali

Well... Welcome! 
I'm a lover of books-classical ones mostly-a runner at heart, and someone who's never shy about speaking my mind. If there's one thing you should know about me, it's that I believe in standing up for what I think is right-and doing something about it.

I am in love with trying to bring education everywhere (pretty crazy that isn't the case). I'm also a huge fan of the journalism industry and believe that traditional journalism is dying at the expense of money and greed (but I'll probably go on and on about this in a blog post later).

When I'm not going on and on about technical subjects, I love running, writing (with tea, not coffee), and learning languages. Turkish is my current obsession.
Welcome and hope you enjoy your visit here
