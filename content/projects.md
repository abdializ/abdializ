## Game Theory Simulation - April 6th 2025

After searching for a game theory simulation that wasn't just educational but actually allowed competitive play, I couldn't find one that fit. Most were limited to static demos or textbook-style visuals. So, I started building my own version of the classic Prisoner's Dilemma as a side project. This is version 1, with support for both multiplayer over a local network and singleplayer versus a bot. I plan to improve it over time, but I'm publishing this first iteration on GitHub soon as a reference for anyone interested.
